# ORStools
Set of tools to use OpenRouteService (ORS) APIÂ´s as a plugin in QGIS (www.openrouteservice.org)

# Functionalities
Use QGIS to generate input for routing and accessibility area analysis powered by ORS, either via clicking coordinates in the map canvas or using point layers for batch operation. 

By default, a testing API key is used which is limited to 40 requests/minute and 500 requests/day. For individual usage, please use the 'Get API key' link in the plugin or visit https://developers.openrouteservice.org/portal/apis/.
