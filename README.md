# ORStools
Set of tools to use OpenRouteService (ORS) APIÂ´s as a plugin in QGIS (www.openrouteservice.org)

# Functionalities
Use QGIS to generate input for routing and accessibility area analysis powered by ORS, either via clicking coordinates in the map canvas or using point layers for batch operation. 

Coordinates of both (clicking tool and point layers) will be transformed to EPSG:4326 internally and sent to ORS API. Output files are also in EPSG:4326.

By default, a public API key is used which is limited to 2500 requests/day.

# Disclaimer
By using this tool set, you agree to ORS terms & conditions (openrouteservice.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/tos.html#terms-of-service)
